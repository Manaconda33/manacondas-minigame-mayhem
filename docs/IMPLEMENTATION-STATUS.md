- Hosted PR CI `35137395927`: PASS — Git LFS verification, clean `npm ci`, strict typecheck, zero-warning lint, **50 test files / 446 tests**, **82.19% statement / 77.39% branch / 86.56% function / 83.70% line coverage**, branding/runtime-asset verification and production build.
- PR #144 squash merge: **`a129bbac75f919dc7136ac50dfd63564fe5cd52e`**.
- Gameplay post-merge validation / GitHub Pages: **`35137681000` PASS**.
- Publication-record reconciliation PR #145 merge: **`e53bf652b88fb50c29e80acbb68062d49e170d96`**.
- PR #145 post-merge validation / GitHub Pages: **`35138696144` PASS**.
- Manny completed the supplied deployed Arc Hammers review routes and reported **“All tests pass.”**
- Product-owner evidence: PR #144 comment **`5703186707`**.
- No browser/device-specific result is inferred beyond Manny's explicit all-tests-pass report.
- Existing Vite large-chunk warning remains known/nonblocking.
- Three moderate npm audit findings remain in the unchanged dependency set.

The four deployed acceptance routes covered primary Arc Hammers gameplay, Shockwave clearing, Prismatic protected absorption, and Prismatic expired ordinary-hit behavior. Arc Hammers has no known open defect at this acceptance checkpoint.

## Rebounding Arc Blade final state

Rebounding Arc Blade remains **LIVE ACCEPTED** under amendment 2.15 / ADR-076. Gameplay PR #139 merged at `8822341b61900799e0166cfe94bf69cb3986bf0e`; post-merge validation/Pages `35118484183` passed; PR #139 comment `5700594653` records Manny's deployed acceptance.

## Slice 5 accepted/deployed state

Live-accepted bounded increments include item boxes/one-slot inventory/roulette/HUD/input foundation, Nitro Surge, Ricochet Kinetic Disc, Homing Seeker Drone, Apex core, Timed Blast Orb/HazardSystem, Slick Trap, Slick/Blast AI hazard response, Acoustic Shockwave Pulse, Prismatic Invincibility, Blaze Orbs, Frost Orbs, Rebounding Arc Blade, and **Kinetic Arc Hammers**.

Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat governance is approved under amendment 2.18 / ADR-079, but gameplay/presentation implementation remains explicitly held pending separate Manny authorization. Three item effects remain unimplemented and not live accepted: **Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat, Continuous Nitro Overdrive, and Hyper-Drive Rocket**.

Remaining Slice 5 closure work also includes full AI item acquisition/use, final all-item interaction/counter evidence, lifecycle/object-count soak, item/VFX performance evidence, final desktop/mobile full-slice acceptance, and issue #106 disposition as appropriate. Slice 6 remains locked.

## Known issues

- Issue #106 remains future development and nonblocking for accepted item increments.
- Existing production-build large-chunk warning remains known and nonblocking.
- Three moderate npm audit findings remain in the unchanged dependency set.
- No Arc Hammers defect is open from the completed acceptance matrix.

## Next recommended action

After this docs-only governance checkpoint is published and verified, stop at the separate **Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat gameplay/presentation authorization gate**. Do not implement Ink until Manny explicitly authorizes that next increment. Slice 6 remains locked.

## Approval state

**Slice 5 design:** APPROVED 2026-09-05.

**Rebounding Arc Blade:** LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-16.

**Kinetic Arc Hammers scope/governance:** APPROVED / PUBLISHED.

**Kinetic Arc Hammers gameplay + original presentation:** **LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-16** through PR #144 / `a129bbac75f919dc7136ac50dfd63564fe5cd52e` / runs `35137395927` and `35137681000` / product-owner comment `5703186707`.

**Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat scope/governance:** **APPROVED 2026-09-16** under amendment 2.18 / ADR-079; governance publication is this docs-only checkpoint; gameplay/presentation remains held pending separate authorization.

**Slice 5 implementation:** IN PROGRESS.

**Slice 6:** LOCKED pending full Slice 5 validation, deployment, and Manny live acceptance.

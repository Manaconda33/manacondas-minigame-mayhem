## Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat deployed implementation and tuning - LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-17

Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat implementation, original presentation, and Amendment 2.19 AI tuning are **MERGED / DEPLOYED / LIVE ACCEPTED** through PRs #148 and #149. Manny reported **“Pass”** after reviewing the deployed tuned `?testItem=ink-splat` route.

Authorization and publication evidence:

- Governance publication PR #147 merged at `b62c96ae8297150d8f4cafaede4623d5b01a1e0b`; hosted PR CI `35145111221` and post-merge validation/Pages `35145254188` passed.

- PR #148 merged at `2df6bf372b01e8a0f13c4bad71737ef8f5ab415d`; hosted PR CI `35168738421` and post-merge validation/Pages `35168880807` passed.
- Amendment 2.19 / ADR-080 tuned the AI impairment to 0.95 m lateral noise, 0.160-second reaction latency, and a 0.74 steering precision multiplier; duration and all other boundaries remain unchanged.
- PR #149 squash-merged at `af4fa73c2a05ad25e4e2d7343f89f3cf6b9f510f`; hosted PR CI `35173826253` and post-merge validation/Pages `35188684882` passed.
- Manny reported **“Pass”** on 2026-09-17; PR #149 comment `5709839182` records the product-owner evidence.

The published bounded implementation includes progress-authoritative all-racers-ahead targeting, atomic one-charge dispatch, per-target immunity, refresh-without-stacking, lifecycle state, legal-road-bounded AI impairment, CSS organic screen overlay below HUD/touch controls, procedural impact audio, and the `?testItem=ink-splat` route.

Hosted post-merge validation passed clean install, Git LFS/runtime-asset verification, strict typecheck, zero-warning lint, **54 test files / 463 tests**, **81.97% statement / 77.31% branch / 86.56% function / 83.52% line coverage**, branding/runtime-asset verification, and production build. Existing Vite large-chunk warning remains known/nonblocking.

The tuned Ink increment is closed at live acceptance. Slice 5 remains active for its remaining bounded work; Slice 6 remains locked.


## Continuous Nitro Overdrive final state - LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-17

Continuous Nitro Overdrive governance, gameplay, VFX, audio, and presentation are complete and LIVE ACCEPTED under amendment 2.20 / ADR-081 and docs/SLICE-5-NITRO-OVERDRIVE-SCOPE.md. Governance PR #151 merged at `6c1fe1b78274b25c23fe6fc0a2090e26c086febb`; hosted PR CI and post-merge validation/Pages run `35223980439` passed. Manny separately authorized the bounded implementation and later reported **“Pass”** on the deployed player-only route.

The approved contract is one charge; immediate first pulse on committed activation; an exactly 6.0 race-second window; subsequent ITEM pulses no faster than every 0.75 race seconds; approximately 0.9-second non-stacking pulses; a 1.15x normal speed cap; neutral additional acceleration; normal dirt/grass penalties; maximum-authority composition with accepted boosts; pause-safe timing; and full expiry/finish/restart/hub/disposal cleanup. The item creates no hostile effect, immunity, projectile, hazard, or shared-capacity object.

The published implementation adds the bounded Overdrive state/transaction path, keyed generic temporary-boost composition, production player desktop/mobile ITEM routing, separate active-window HUD state, original procedural rear VFX, and original procedural activation/pulse audio. Validation passed with **55 test files / 473 tests**, **81.99% statement / 77.32% branch / 86.55% function / 83.55% line coverage**, strict typecheck, zero-warning lint, branding/runtime-asset verification, and production build. Hosted gameplay PR #152 CI `35230154302` passed; post-merge validation and GitHub Pages deployment `35230540886` also passed. The known Vite large-chunk warning remains nonblocking.

The deployed player-only route is `?testItem=nitro-overdrive`. Manny reported **“Pass”** on 2026-09-17. No browser/device-specific result is inferred beyond that explicit report. Full AI item use/tactics, final cross-item evidence, soak/performance, issue #106, and final Slice 5 closure remain open.

## Hyper-Drive Rocket final state - LIVE ACCEPTED 2026-09-17

Hyper-Drive Rocket gameplay, original procedural model/VFX/audio/presentation, and the bounded player-only acceptance route are **MERGED / DEPLOYED / LIVE ACCEPTED** under amendment 2.21 / ADR-082 and docs/SLICE-5-HYPER-DRIVE-ROCKET-SCOPE.md. Product-owner live acceptance was reported as **“Approved”** on 2026-09-17 after reviewing the deployed `?testItem=hyper-drive-rocket` route.

Authorization and publication evidence:

- Governance publication PR #154 merged at `ae977623bdc7a209634816e1cea8ef4a799b98c8`; post-merge validation and Pages run `35243454845` passed.
- Publication record reconciliation PR #155 merged at `ae40eaa630cc997f452c39b8e312a7ada0441bd0`.
- Separate gameplay implementation authorization was approved on 2026-09-17.
- Gameplay PR #156 squash-merged at `4ae7c6aece6070bb95df889be7059eb91195cd1e`.
- Hosted post-merge validation and GitHub Pages run `35251643282` passed; its validation and deploy jobs both completed successfully.
- Local validation before publication passed with **56 test files / 485 tests**, **82.15% statement / 77.31% branch / 86.72% function / 83.74% line coverage**, strict typecheck, zero-warning lint, branding/runtime-asset verification, and production build.
- Product-owner acceptance evidence is recorded in PR #156 comment `5718483417`.
- The deployed player-only review route is `?testItem=hyper-drive-rocket`. General AI item acquisition/use/tactics and remaining full-Slice-5 closure gates are unchanged and remain open.

## Full AI item tactics - merged / deployed; corrective acceptance gate open

Full AI item acquisition/use/tactics was merged through PR #158 at **`cb67183b902e7732b3cab8d95af3e865890b1835`**. Hosted PR CI **`35255837582`** and post-merge validation / GitHub Pages **`35256074171`** passed. The deployed deterministic fixture remains `?testAiItem=<item-id>&testAiRacer=ai-1`; the existing `?testItem=<item-id>` fixture remains player-only.

Manny's live review found two blocking defects before acceptance: the displayed ranking could disagree with checkpoint-authoritative lap/finish state, and racer-owned AI effects (including Nitro Overdrive) did not render their existing procedural visuals. The bounded corrective implementation is authorized under ADR-084. It uses post-physics swept crossings for the next required checkpoint, shares validated snapshots between standings/item ranking/targeting/AI gaps, and mounts the existing Nitro Surge, Nitro Overdrive, Hyper-Drive Rocket, and Prismatic visuals for AI racers. It does not alter item balance, AI tactics, audio, race rules, assets, or Slice 6 scope.

The corrective branch has focused sweep-gate, validated-progress, AI-race/Rocket, and AI visual lifecycle coverage. On 2026-09-17, clean-install `npm ci` and `npm run validate` passed with **60 test files / 499 tests**, **81.48% statement / 76.81% branch / 85.88% function / 83.19% line coverage**, strict typecheck, zero-warning lint, runtime-asset/branding verification, and a production build; `git diff --check` and `git lfs fsck` also passed. Hosted PR CI, deployment, and a fresh live review of lap/finish/standings consistency plus visible AI item effects remain required before accepting the deployed AI tactics increment.

## Slice 5 accepted/deployed state

Live-accepted bounded increments include item boxes/one-slot inventory/roulette/HUD/input foundation, Nitro Surge, Ricochet Kinetic Disc, Homing Seeker Drone, Apex core, Timed Blast Orb/HazardSystem, Slick Trap, Slick/Blast AI hazard response, Acoustic Shockwave Pulse, Prismatic Invincibility, Blaze Orbs, Frost Orbs, Rebounding Arc Blade, **Kinetic Arc Hammers**, **Continuous Nitro Overdrive**, and **Hyper-Drive Rocket**.

Vision-Obscuring Ink Splat gameplay/presentation and Amendment 2.19 AI tuning are merged, deployed, and live accepted under amendments 2.18-2.19 / ADR-079-080 through PRs #148-149. Continuous Nitro Overdrive is merged, deployed, and live accepted under amendment 2.20 / ADR-081 through PR #152. **Hyper-Drive Rocket gameplay and original presentation are merged, deployed, and live accepted under amendment 2.21 / ADR-082 through PR #156.**

Remaining Slice 5 closure work includes closing the approved full-AI corrective acceptance gate, final all-item interaction/counter evidence, lifecycle/object-count soak, item/VFX performance evidence, final desktop/mobile full-slice acceptance, and issue #106 disposition as appropriate. Slice 6 remains locked.

## Known issues

- Issue #106 remains future development and nonblocking for accepted item increments.
- The deployed full-AI-tactics checkpoint is not live accepted while the approved lap/finish/standings and AI racer-owned visual corrections await review.
- Existing production-build large-chunk warning remains known and nonblocking.
- Three moderate npm audit findings remain in the unchanged dependency set.
- No Arc Hammers defect is open from the completed acceptance matrix.

## Next recommended action

Complete the corrective validation and open its review PR; do not merge or claim deployment/live acceptance without Manny's later approval. Slice 6 remains locked.
